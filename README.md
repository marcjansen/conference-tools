Tools for organizing conferences
================================

This is a repository with tools and scripts I assembled over the years. It it centred around [pretalx], the best system to organize a conference I know of.

 - [email_upload_links]: Create emails with upload links to [Seafile]
 - [copy_uploads]: Copy files on [Seafile] for reviewers and add an additional file with additional information
 - [cut_to_schedule]: Copy the processed files on [Seafile] into a directory structure based on a [pretalx] schedule
 - [download_files]: Download files from a password protected directory from [Seafile]
 - [list_prerecorded_talks]: Get a schedule of the pre-recorded and live talks
 - [email_speaker_final]: Create emails with status of pre-recorded files
 - [utils]: Utilities and scripts for reuse, e.g. for sending mails

For running the scripts you need to configure your API keys and other setting in configuration file `config`. You can do this by copying the sample and edit the file for your needs.:
```
cp config.sample config
vi config
```
